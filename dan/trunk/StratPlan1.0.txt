Danger Language 

Strategic plan for Danger 1.0

commstime
basic scheduling
static allocation
procs in pars

0.1 - complete

module linking/libraries
bare channels (i.e. channels not in bundles)
proc calls outside par
tail recursive proc calls
unsafe C calls

1st unit tests
compiler error handling

0.2

alt
timeouts
skip
strings basic
invariant objects
dynamic memory
recursive procs
exceptions
tuples

primitive types first pass complete (will be finished as part of 1.0 libs definition, post 0.5)

0.3

mobile channels and bundles
mutable envelope objects
envelop objects with envelope allocation
shared envelop objects
interfaces
type inference
arrays

0.4 

basic time library
basic file library
basic network library
basic collections library/or builtin collections types (vector and map)

0.5

unsafe operations
gap analysis with C (should be roughly as capable as C eventually, even if unsafe operations aren't as easy and reflexive as in C, and even if all of C's capabilities aren't addressed in 1.0)
asm blocks
absolute memory locations

0.6

validation and verification of 1.0 scope
plan versions through 0.9

installer

scheduler and memory pool interfaces

generics 
attributes
reflection
lambdas
properties

fast alt
define & implement 1.0 libraries
runtime support for windows & linux threads (multi-core support)
runtime support for bare metal multi-core
C or other language interop
define & implement 1.0 strings

0.9

Testing, testing, 1, 2, 3, testing.
